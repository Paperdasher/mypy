##Day 15: Intro to Loops(while loops)

"""
When we want to perform an operation until some condition turns false, we don't want to write code over and over again.
If we don't know how many repititions we'd need, it's impossible to write out all that code.
We use loops to cover that need. We keep iterating until the condition is invalid, and we exit the code block.
"""

a = 1
while(a < 10):
    print(a) # what do you think this prints? Up to what number?
    a += 1 

print("Final value of a:", a) # what will this print?

"""
Exercises:

Write a function where...
1. Removes all odd numbers from a list
2. Takes the sum of all elements in the list until a neg num
3. Finds the largest number in a list
