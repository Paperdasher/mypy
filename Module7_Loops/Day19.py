## Day 19 & 20: Sorting Algorithms

"""
Now that we're comfortable with Data Structures and Loops, let's put them to test together.
When we have a list of numbers, it can be beneficial to have them sorted. When we say "sorted", we usually mean in acsending order.
There are many algorithms in the world to accomplish this. Although most likely the three worst, let's practice using algorithms designed for educational purposes.

1. Bubble sort

2. Selection sort

3. Insertion sort

## SELECTION SORT:

## INSERTION SORT:
