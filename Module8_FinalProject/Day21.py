##Day 21: Final Project

"""
Now that you've accumulated adequate coding skills using Python, put it all to test in this project.

Create a 4*4 Tic Tac Toe game, which the computer randomly selects a place to mark after every user move. The player chooses what symbol to represent them(ex. x, o).
The board should be updated after every turn and shown to the user during the plays. If the computer already chose the spot they input, make them choose another.
Don't use turtles, simply print lines of the board.

You must use helper functions for this project. Use clear variable names, and make clear what function does what.
Ex. board_position instead of b, def computer_move instead of def comp

I will be calling the function tictactoe to test. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE TICTACTOE FUNCTION NAME.
