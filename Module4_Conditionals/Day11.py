Also, print out that the number is small if it is less than ten

### Exercise: Work on If-statements category problems on CodingBat. Share your screen so I can see you coding. Try to complete all problems.

HW:
1. Create a function that takes in the temperature(int) as a parameter.
- Make ranges for what constitutes "hot", "cold", "freezing", etc. (make it reasonable! 100 deg is not "cold")
- Print out "the temperature is cold", "... is hot", etc. depending on the range category the temp is in

2. Complete rest of If-statements category on CodingBat.
