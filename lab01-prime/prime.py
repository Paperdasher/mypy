## Lab01- Prime ##

# You will be writing two functions, isPrime and nthPrime. 
# Read the function documentation carefully. 
# Test your code thoroughly.

# return true if and only if x is prime, false otherwise
# assume n is an integer
def isPrime(n):
    # Check divisibility for all values from 2 to n-1 inclusive
    # Although this is not a good algorithm, use this for simplicity
    return False





# Return the nth prime
# e.g. nthPrime(0) returns 2, nthPrime(1) returns 3
def nthPrime(n):
    # Loop through values and check if they are prime until you find n of them
    # Use your isPrime function to check if a number is prime
    return -1
