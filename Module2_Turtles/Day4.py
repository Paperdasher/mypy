##Day 4: Turtles Part 2

"""
We can use the methods in the library to create different shapes.
For instance, we can create circles by giving the radius to the circle method in the turtle library.

We can also color the inside of shapes, a useful feature don't you think?

When we move the turtle, we don't always want it to be drawing. Unlike drawing exercises where the artist doesn't pick up their pencil,
we don't want continuity for all our shapes. So we need a way to determine when the turtle is drawing and when not to draw.
We can use the penup/pen down functionality in the library to accomplish this.
