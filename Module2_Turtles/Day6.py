##Day 6: Turtles Part 3- Using Functions

import turtle

"""
Since we know how to draw shapes, we can expand it to any type.
Try drawing 7 triangles of different sizes, angle measurments, and orientation.

"""
Knowing how to write functions, we can apply it to turtles.
If we wanted to make a equilateral triangle of side length 10, or a square with side length 20, how would we code that?

Functions allow us to give a input of a certain parameter, and the function will do the action for us without us having to manually code each case.
This allows for easier automation, and flexibility to call the function with each necessary input. 

For this exercise, create a function for drawing a equilateral triangle, right triangle, and a square.
