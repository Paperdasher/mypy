# Lab03- Sorting 


# In this lab, you will be writing three different sorting methods. 
# The three algorithms are selection sort, a bubble sort, and a insertion sort.
# Although there are not good algorithms to sort a list, they serve as a good educational purpose to understand list structure.


# Read the README on the repo to understand each algorithm. 
# Understanding the algorithm should also allow you to think about the time complexity.
