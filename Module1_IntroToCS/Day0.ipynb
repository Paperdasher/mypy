This emulates a hardware device that runs programs.\n","In some cases, there are IDE(Integrated development environment) that allow you to directly run Python code.\n","\n","On your computer, you have what is commonly known as \"files.\" In CS, we call these \"directories.\"\n","When you open the \"file explorer,\" it's a more user-friendly version of what we can do with the terminal.\n","The file explorer makes it easier to navigate through files. In the terminal, we see only the file names.\n","When we write code, our programs can access other files(pictures such as .jpg, data such as .csv, .txt, other code, etc.)"],"metadata":{"id":"oZoOQUyaDirZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---"],"metadata":{"id":"ZMNbv04kEpQu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Common Commands**\n","- cd(change-directory): changes the current directory\n","Ex. when you open the terminal: cd Documents/MyPy/Python/Module1_IntroToCS\n","Tip: to go outside of a directory, use the .. keyword.
