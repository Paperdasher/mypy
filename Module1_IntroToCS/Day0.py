## Day 0: Terminal Commands

"""
Welcome! This is the platform, repl.it, that we will be using for our lessons. 
This is the repository(known as repl on this platform) but more commonly short as repo.
Before we get into learning Python, we need to learn a bit about how to use this platform in order to access and run our Python files.

In more user-friendly platforms such as Scratch, there is the "Run" feature that runs the given program.
In code, we run our code through the terminal, which is a software on your computer. This emulates a hardware device that runs programs.
In some cases, there are IDE(Integrated development environment) that allow you to directly run Python code.
However, repl.it is an online platform that doesn't directly operate with a "Run" button. Instead, it provides us with a terminal in the platform.
By giving terminal commands, we can replicate software that needs to be installed with this online platform.

On your computer, you have what is commonly known as "files." In CS, we call these "directories."
When you open the "file explorer," it's a more user-friendly version of what we can do with the terminal.
The file explorer makes it easier to navigate through files. In the terminal, we see only the file names.
When we write code, our programs can access other files(pictures such as .jpg, data such as .csv, .txt, other code, etc.)

Common commands beneficial to know-
- cd(change-directory): changes the current directory
Ex. when you open the terminal: cd Documents/MyPy/Python/Module1_IntroToCS
Tip: to go outside of a directory, use the .. keyword. (ex. cd ../.. -> goes to MyPy directory)

- mkdir(make-directory): makes a new directory in the current directory
Ex. make a new module: mkdir ModuleX

To open your terminal, simply click the key with the Windows logo to popup the app finder. Then type "terminal." 
Note: Other complex commands may differ based on the system(Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux)

For Python, there are two common commands that are used to run Python files. There is the "py" and the "python" command.
Depending on the system, one of the two will run your Python file. For this platform, the "python" keyword will run files.
So when running your homework file, try cd-ing into the right directory, then using "python DayXHW.py"

Exercise:

Try on the terminal provided below on repl.it

1. From Module2_Turtles, change directories into Module7_Loops
2. Try running this file(be careful to come back into this directory).

print("Welcome Gabriel!")
print("You've successfully run this file. Great job!")
