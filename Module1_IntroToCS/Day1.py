## As you can notice, this is a comment and will not run when called
## Anything after the # symbol is considered a comment for that line
""""
This is a multi-line comment. This can be done using three quotes to start and to end. 
You can find more info about comments at this link: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp

In Python, there are multiple data types. The most common ones are:
- str(String)
- int(Integer)
- float(Decimal)
- bool(Boolean)
- list
- dict(Dictionary)
- range
"""



## Strings
"""
A String is a type where any character can be written inside a "" or a ''. It's like a conversation, anything can be inside of it.
We can have a string of numbers "12345" or a word "Hello User!" or a combination of both "Hello User 12345!"
Those are some of the glimpse of this data type. We can print literal strings using print(). 

Multi-line strings can be written just like a comment. These comments are technically multi-line strings, but since they aren't printed
won't affect the code.
"""


a = "Hello"
print("Hola")
print('Bonjour')
print(a)

## int
"""
An int is like the integers you deal with in math class. They don't contain decimals, and can be both negative or positive.
So, 5 is a valid int and so is -2000. 
"""

b = 5
c = -2000
print(b)
print(c)
