## Day 19 & 20: Sorting Algorithm Testing

"""
Testing your code is important to be sure that it is sufficient for the problem.
Although there is only one method of steps to take for each algorithm in this case, there are many implementations.

We have what are called "edge cases." These are unusual cases where the normal algorithm/code may break.
We should also test each type of list, there are many different sequences of arbitrary values that can be used.
Also, we can make an extremely large list by using the random feature to generate random values.

You should write many test cases, not just one or two.

It is probably a good idea to have a random list generator using random values and a inputted list length 
after testing if other manually generated lists are passing tests.
There is a built-in sort method(list.sort(default false, reverse = True triggers descending sort)), and this may help to see if two lists are equal or not.
This means it would also be a good idea to have a function that tests whether two lists are equal or not.

Try to think of other functions that may be beneficial to have for testing.
